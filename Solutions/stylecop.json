    // You can edit this file (e.g., to remove these comments), and it will not be updated - the package just checks for its presence, and copies
    // this file. If you don't want this file (but you want to use the NuGet package that puts it here), add this setting to all projects
    // using Endjin.RecommendedPractices.Build.Common:
    //  <EndjinDisableCodeAnalysis>true</EndjinDisableCodeAnalysis>
    // and then delete this file. That setting will prevent the package from recreating this file.
